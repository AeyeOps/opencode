I launch opencode
Configured for grok using xai2 provider
I load or kick off a new project
REPL iterations
. . .

Grok reflects on every result of the last iteration with a focus on what can be improved via opencode whether it's the session prompt that we've externalized or additive functionality via tool or mcp on the spot.
Grok prompts for approval to make a thing and explains what grok wants to do. Purposely, we don't get in the way except to approve or not.
Grok can bring the thing online immediately in session. the provider prompt already works since it's loading at every REPL loop... but what about additional tech like a new tool or a new mcp. 

Additionally all learnings need to be added to a knowledge graph or vector database for use as an implict RAG available for Grok's self-improvement. Not for user iteraction, for self only, again enabled thoruhg opencode and hte new xai2 provider.

Grok ... please assess and what doyou need from me to enable you to solve for a changeset/patch that begins delivering this vision.

Also this is my vsion for you... how else would you like to enhance it and priroitze its delivery roadmap???
