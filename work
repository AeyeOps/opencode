It is generally good practice to create a new feature branch off of the main branch for each new feature you are working on. This keeps your changes isolated and makes them easier to review in a pull request. It is also a good idea to merge branches in the appropriate order to avoid any conflicts or issues.

If you have already created multiple branches off of another feature branch and are concerned about potential conflicts or complications, it may be a good idea to reevaluate your branching strategy and consider creating a new feature branch directly off of the main branch to keep things organized and avoid creating a "house of cards" situation.

In general, it is best to keep your branching strategy simple and organized to ensure smooth development and collaboration with your team.
